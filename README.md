During a 5 month long internship I conducted my thesis at research institute Deltares. My research
has been focussed on ground vibrations that occur during the installation of sheet piles. The
underlying motivation of my research is the potential damage that could occur at nearby buildings.
Geotechnical engineers often resort to vibration predictions to asses the risk of a construction
project. The majority of the engineers use an empirical model mentioned in the CUR 166 when
making predictions.
My research can be divided into two parts:
1. Performing an empirical evaluation on the accuracy and the safety of the CUR-166 model.
2. Creating a new model with the use of machine learning.


My thesis was the first time that the CUR-166 model was empirically evaluated on a large data set. In
my research I concluded that the existing model was inaccurate and should not be used in the
vibration prediction process.
The usage of machine learning led only to minor improvements. At the completion of my thesis I
analyzed what it was that made vibration predictions so complex. This led to many suggestions for
further research. 


Most machine learning has been done in Weka. My bachelor thesis is in Dutch. Due to privacy reasons, the data is not published.
